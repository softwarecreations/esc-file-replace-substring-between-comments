# esc-file-replace-substring-between-comments
Replace substring (all lines) between comments in a file.

## Project goals
* No dependencies
* No nonsense
* Reliable, no radical changes will ever happen.
* Small, simple, easy to audit, yourself

If I have ideas for something different, I'll make a new package rather than make breaking changes.
